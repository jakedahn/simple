# Simple

Minimalistic [Ghost](http://tryghost.org) theme from [Jake Dahn](http://jake.ai)

This theme was ported from my blogging platform, [Everyone.me](http://everyone.me). I finally decided to abandon ship when I saw ghost and fell in love with the in-browser markdown editor.

Right now the stylesheets are all compressed, but when there is some documentation about how to use less/scss I will port the actual style over in readable format.
